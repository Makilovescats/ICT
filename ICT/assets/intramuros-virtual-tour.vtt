00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome to Intramuros, Manila's storied walled city.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.500
We begin at Plaza Roma, the civic heart framed by Manila Cathedral.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.000
Imagine horse-drawn carriages clip-clopping along cobblestone streets.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Next stop: Fort Santiago, sentinel of Manila's harbor.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Reflect at the Rizal Shrine, honoring José Rizal's final steps.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.500
Follow the ramparts for panoramic views of the Pasig River skyline.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.000
Don't miss San Agustin Church, the only UNESCO-listed Baroque church inside the walls.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Recharge with tsokolate and ensaymada at an ancestral casa courtyard.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
As dusk approaches, Intramuros glows with lanterns and live serenades.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
End your loop back at Plaza Moriones—capturing the city that endures.
